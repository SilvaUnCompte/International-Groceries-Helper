# International Groceries Helper
A useful little website for converting currencies when shopping for groceries in another country.

## Why?
I'm currently a French intern in Denmark, and I feel stupid every time I think, “Oh my God, 22.95 for juice?!” But 22.95 DKK is only 3,08 € in reality, so it's okay ...

And no, dividing by 7.5 in my head every time takes too long... A calculator? Yes, but you have to type the calculation... I'm pretty lazy, I'm a developer, it's mandatory, right?

So I'd rather spend a day creating a web application that does the math for me.

## Conclusion?

Now I feel stupid every time I think, “Oh my God, $22.95 for a juice?!” But with one finger, I can find out the real price without checking if the conversion rate has changed (Mmf...).

Addendum: feel free to be as lazy as me and install the progressive web app ahah
